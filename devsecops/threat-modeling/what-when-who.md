trying to reduce risk ( like reducing attack surface)

`RISK = IMPACT * LIKELEHOOD`

# why? 

pro-active approach instead finding threats afterwards : security up front

efficient : sooner you find a bug it's cheaper to fix

pioritize bugs : based on output (diagrams)

better understanding : better docs

# who:

collaborative , repeatable process not a   one time

architect + develpoer + tester + security professional 

# when : 

early as possible

each sprint
